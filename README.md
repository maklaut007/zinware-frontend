## Approach

### User stories

First thing before creating a website I wrote user stories of how user should interact with pages. I split my work into interations between which I did my backend for the next one.

Iteration One - Public pages:

- As a user, I should be able to see a list of categories to pick a type I device I want to buy.
- As a user, I should be able to open a category to see a list of devices of similar type.
- As a user, I should be able to open individual device page so I can order that specific device.

Iteration Two - Authorization:

- As a user, I should be able to register account to buy products.
- As a user, I should be able to login to my account to buy products.

Iteration Three - Cart interaction:

- As a user, I should be able to add product to cart in any quantity I want.
- As a user, I should be able open my cart to see what products I'm planning to buy.
- As a user, I should be able to remove product from cart if I'm don't want to order it.
- As a user, I should be able to change quantity of specific product to oreder in my cart.

Iteration Four - Chekcout:

- As a user, I should be able to checkout products in my cart so they will be delivered to me.

### Visualizing

After creating user stories I created basic website scetches as starting point for my design as well as choosing colors for my design. As a design tool I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

<img src="assets/../src/assets/readme-images/Categories.png" style="width: 300px"><img src="assets/../src/assets/readme-images/Category-product.png" style="width: 300px"> <img src="assets/../src/assets/readme-images/Product.png" style="max-width: 300px" >

Colors for my page were:

- ![#073357](https://placehold.co/15x15/073357/073357.png) `#073357` - first background color
- ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/000a18/000a18.png) `#000a18` - second background color
- ![#69c7f3](https://placehold.co/15x15/69c7f3/69c7f3.png) `#69c7f3` - first text color
- ![#69c7f3](https://placehold.co/15x15/f5f9fa/f5f9fa.png) `#f5f9fa` - second text color

### Result

I created 7 total pages with their own functionality and purpose

- Categories page
- Category products page
- Product page
- Registation page
- Login page
- Cart page
- Checkout page

## Planing documentation

As a planning documentation for this and [backend project](https://github.com/maklaut007/zinware-backend) I used Trello board:
